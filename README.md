# App Name: Student Market

# About:
Student Market is a virtual market place that enables university students to post any products and services that they sell to their peers. 
Our platform can be accessed by other university students within their vicinity and even around universities nationwide, depending on the range that their product or service can reach. Students can use the app as both a buyer and a seller. 

Many students are now business oriented and venture into self employment while studying to make a steady income. An income that can provide for their basic needs and potentially pay off their student fees and debts. They often deploy business solutions that target their fellow students by providing them with goods and services that appeal to their needs and wants, suitable for the student budget. 

While the drive and initiative is there, the main obstacle remains that the students are limited to a small number of customers, and lack the resources to market and reach larger markets, even within their own universities. 

Our platform provides these young entrepreneurs a larger pool for their target market so they can expand their customer base and thus generate more income. 

Concurrent to this, other students that previously were not exposed to these goods and services are able to find access to them at the touch of a button. Not only are they able to get goods and services at affordable student prices and suitable for their current needs, they also get them in a safe and secure environment knowing that these goods and services are provided by fellow students. 

For example, if a certain student is offering a nail or hair service at their residence, other students will feel comfortable and safe going to get their hair and nails done, as they know that all residences are safe, secure and probably close to them. This is a great benefit especially for students that study away from their home provinces. They will no longer have to travel too deep into the cities of a new province because they will be able to see that other students, either within their residence or nearby areas, offer these goods and services. 

Products that could be  listed on the app are thrifted clothing, kotas, study packages, textbooks, ingredient packs, sanitary pad packages, amagwinya, snacks and cosmetics. Some of the services offered will be fridge cleaning services, laundry services, hair and nail services and tutoring services.


Ultimately, the platform contributes towards the solution for youth unemployment by giving young entrepreneurs an accessible way to make valuable income, as well as the necessary business and administrative skills required of running a business. 

The application acts as an incubator for young entrepreneurs to flex their entrepreneurial muscles and gain skills that they can use in future to employ themselves and possibly employ others.
